Music Database README

Introduction
This project contains sample data and instructions to set up a MongoDB database for a music catalog. It includes three collections: "Songs," "Artists," and "Popular Songs." The data provided in this project is entirely fictional and is meant to serve as a starting point for creating a music-related database in MongoDB.

I make this database using  MongoDb Compass & Atlas for the cloud

If you want to check the database collection you can use your MongoDB Compass and then copy the connection string below
mongodb+srv://mycluster:<password>@cluster0.4bkzqig.mongodb.net/

And then copy the url above and paste into the mongodb compass url and it will be
mongodb+srv://mycluster:******@cluster0.4bkzqig.mongodb.net/

Change/Replace the password/***** into "2804" without " 
Ex :
mongodb+srv://mycluster:2804@cluster0.4bkzqig.mongodb.net/

and Welcome to My Cluster Mongodb Atlas using MongoDb Compass

after you connect into my db you can check database named "Music"
and you can check there's 3 collections named "Songs", "artists", "popular songs"

and check all the json file and dummy data.
